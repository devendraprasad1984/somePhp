        <strong>Who We Are...</strong><br>
        We established in the year of 2014 spearheaded by individuals who strive to be difference makers utilizing technology<br>
        as a solution to combat the global epidemic of plastic pollution. Avani provides a game-changing compostable bioplastic made<br>
        from cassava starch as well as a full range of sustainable food packaging and hospitality products made from renewable resources<br>
        Through years of research and development prior to its launch, Avani have came up with groundbreaking technology that enables them <br>
        to replace the otherwise disposable plastic products which take hundreds and even thousands of years to be decomposed by Mother <br>
        nature by using renewable resources made from plants. Parallel to that, as a social impact enterprise, we are committed to exercise <br>
        good corporate governance through our business practices as well as adopting the Triple Bottom Line approach in assuring the <br>
        sustainability of our business.<br>
