        Many products which are marketed as 'eco-friendly' may not necessarily be beneficial to the environment.<br>
        The notion of 'greenwashing' has been the common denominator done by many 'green' companies worldwide in order to maximize<br>
        profit without the sincere integrity and passion in striving for a cleaner and greener world. Here at Avani, we believe<br>
        that there is no grey area - we are fully committed to deliver the most economical best in class eco-friendly products with<br>
        ZERO tolerance towards using petroleum-based plastic in order to save our planet from this ongoing massive plastic epidemic.<br>
